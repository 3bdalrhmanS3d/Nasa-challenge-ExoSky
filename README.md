**ExoSky: Imagine the night sky from an exoplanet perspective**

ExoSky is an interactive app that allows students to identify a planet from the solar system and visualize the night sky from this perspective. 
Using data from star catalogues such as the ESA Gaia DR3 catalogue, the app generates unique star charts and perceptions,
enabling users to draw and name towers, just as our ancestors did on Earth.
Whether you're printing a static blueprint for stars, exploring VR, or tracking new towers, ExoSky offers an immersive learning experience!
